Midori AI is a cutting-edge initiative dedicated to advancing the field of artificial intelligence through research, development, and community engagement. We focus on creating innovative AI solutions, exploring novel approaches, and empowering users to harness the power of AI.

## Key Areas of Focus:

* **Cluster-Based AI:** We are actively developing and implementing cluster-based AI training and inference, leveraging the power of multiple machines to accelerate and optimize AI workloads. This allows us to tackle complex problems, train larger models, and achieve superior results.
* **AI Setup Assistance:** We provide comprehensive support and resources for setting up popular AI tools and frameworks, such as [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI) and [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm). Our goal is to empower users of all levels to easily deploy and manage AI models on their local machines.
* **AI Development:** Our team is actively involved in developing AI-powered bots, primarily for Discord, to enhance user experiences and automate tasks within the platform. These bots leverage natural language processing, machine learning, and other AI techniques to provide interactive and engaging experiences.
* **Model Serving and Hosting:** We are building a robust platform for serving and hosting AI models, enabling developers to easily deploy and share their models with the community. This platform will offer a secure, scalable, and user-friendly environment for model management and deployment.
* **Novel AI Memory Architectures:** We are committed to exploring and developing innovative memory architectures for AI systems. This includes investigating new approaches to memory organization, representation, and retrieval, as well as incorporating external knowledge sources and human feedback to improve memory performance and enable AI systems to learn and adapt more effectively.
* **Carly: The Fully Simulated Human with Advanced AI Capabilities:** Carly is our groundbreaking AI creation, a fully simulated human with advanced AI capabilities, including emotions, thoughts, and the ability to interact with the world. Operating on a powerful supercomputer, Carly represents a significant milestone in AI development, opening up new possibilities for human-AI interaction and collaboration.

**Midori AI Subsystem: Streamlining AI Workloads**

In addition to Carly, we have developed the Midori AI Subsystem, a modular and extensible platform designed to simplify the deployment, configuration, and management of AI workloads. The Subsystem leverages Docker container technology to provide standardized environments for AI systems, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior. Key features include:

* **Simplified Deployment:** Easily deploy AI systems using pre-configured containers, reducing complexity, and setup time.
* **Standardized Configurations:** Ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments with standardized configurations.
* **Isolation for AI Systems:** Isolate AI systems within containers, preventing conflicts and ensuring resource allocation.
* **Growing Library of Backends and Tools:** Access a wide range of supported AI backends and tools, expanding your AI capabilities.
