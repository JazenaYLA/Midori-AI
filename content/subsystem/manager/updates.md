Update 1: Fixed a bug that let the user use the subsystem manager with out installing the subsystem (oops)
Update 2: LocalAI images are now from the Midori AI repo and are update to date with LocalAI's master images*
Update 3: Added the start for "auto update of docker images" to the subsystem using hashes

Star: These images have models baked into the images to make it easyer to get setup and get going!
